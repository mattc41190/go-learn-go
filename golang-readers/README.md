# golang-readers

## What is this?

This repo is a collection of examples which attempt to look at the GoLang Reader type in high detail.

## Why make this?

I see readers pop up all over the GoLang world, and for some reason it doesn't always click. So, I am gonna make a bunch of readers and see if anything makes the magical learning click happen. Each example repo will explain itself in great detail so that if anything ever drops out of my mind, like it very often does, I will be able to quickly and accurately regain my knowledge.

## How do I run this?

- `git clone <this-repo>`
- `cd </path/to/example>`
- `go run *.go`
