# go-wiki
_A mostly useful wiki-like program written in GoLang_

## What is this?

`go-wiki` is a tutorial project which, when run behaves a lot like a wiki. It leaves plenty to be desired, in terms of security, user experience, and test coverage, but is able to create, save and display data written to it. This project was made by following along closely with the code [here](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/)

## Why make this?

As stated above. This is a tutorial project and my first lesson in how GoLang web projects might be created.

## How do I use this?

The easiest way would be to clone this repo into your `$GOPATH/src` directory, `cd` into it and run `go run server.go page.go`

## Questions I Still Have:

1. Where is the value of a written response actually sent to the client?
2.
