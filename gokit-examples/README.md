## What is this?

This repo is a collection of simple ways to use the GoKit MicroService platform helpers. This collection of microservice helpers is currently under investigation for adoptions at HomeAway.

## Why make this? 

To provide myself with working examples that I wrote, compiled and tested using GoKit. The patterns represented here should help a new comer to GoKit micro-service architecture get familiar.
