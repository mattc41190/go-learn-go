# GoKit

A gentle as you can introduction to a powerful, but complex microservice standard library for GoLang.

## Introduction

I am hoping to explain a few concepts. 

1. How does a GoKit server actually work
2. How does a GoKit client actually work.
3. How do I run a microservice ecosystem using GoKit

## Pre-Requisites

So, before you try to get into the guts of how the underlying code works the following are some practical pre-requsites.

1. Understand GoLang Net and Net/HTTP packages.
2. Do each of the example projects included.
    - They are all included here, as well as thorough explanations as to what is happening. Most people will likely only need to do the examples. This document is intended for use by people wanting to really dig in and understand how the things works. If you are trying to create value then understanding the patterns included in the example projects is more than sufficient. However, for those of you wishing to understand how everything works under the hood these examples are a great place to start your journey.
